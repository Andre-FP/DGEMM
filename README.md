# Development of a Risc-V Microprocessor with pipeline of 5 stages

The repository consists of four works from the discipline "Computer Architecture" at UFRJ, based on the book Computer Organization and Design [1].

Three of these works are related to the main project of the discipline, which is to develop a RISC-V microprocessor with a 5-stage pipeline, using the VHDL language.
The goal is to make this microprocessor capable of processing basic assembly instructions, as well as implementing some AVX instructions and enabling the processor to execute them.
